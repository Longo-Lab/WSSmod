# Calculate Weighted Sum Scores Using Signed Protein Values

This function calculates module scores by sign-flipping proteins based
on their biomarker associations (mean_beta) and weighting by alpha
centrality. This approach aligns proteins in the direction of core
biomarker progression and weights by network importance and biomarker
association strength.

## Usage

``` r
calculate_WSS(
  expr_matrix,
  result = NULL,
  prebuilt = "core_AD_plasma_biomarkers",
  dedup_by = "mean_alpha_scaled",
  min_module_size = 3
)
```

## Arguments

- expr_matrix:

  A numeric matrix with samples as rows and genes/proteins as columns,
  already normalized and scaled (see Details). Column names should match
  the 'symbol' values in the result table. Proteins used by a module
  must not have missing values (see Details).

- result:

  A data.table containing module information with required columns:
  module, symbol (gene identifiers), mean_beta (for sign-flipping),
  mean_alpha_scaled (for weighting). A data.frame is converted to a
  data.table; any other class is an error. If `NULL` (the default), a
  prebuilt reference set shipped with the package is used instead; see
  `prebuilt`.

- prebuilt:

  Name of a prebuilt reference set to use when `result` is `NULL`.
  Defaults to `"core_AD_plasma_biomarkers"`. See
  [`list_prebuilt_wss()`](https://Longo-Lab.github.io/WSSmod/reference/list_prebuilt_wss.md)
  for available options. Ignored if `result` is supplied.

- dedup_by:

  Name of the column used to rank duplicate gene/module assignments when
  a gene appears in `result` more than once; only the highest-ranked
  assignment per gene is kept. Defaults to `"mean_alpha_scaled"`.

- min_module_size:

  Minimum number of genes a module must retain (after deduplication) to
  be included in the output. Defaults to `3`, matching the module size
  filter (`N > 2`) used to build the original
  `core_AD_plasma_biomarkers` reference set.

## Value

A list containing:

- scores:

  Matrix of Weighted Sum Scores (samples x modules)

- summary_stats:

  data.table with summary statistics for each module score

- module_sd:

  Named vector of standard deviations for each module

- module_proteins:

  List of protein names in each module

A module with none of its proteins in `expr_matrix` cannot be scored. It
triggers a warning, has all-`NA` scores and a `module_sd` of 0, and is
left out of `summary_stats` and `module_proteins`.

## Details

For each module, proteins are sign-flipped based on sign(mean_beta) to
align all proteins in the direction of disease progression. The signed
values are then weighted by mean_alpha_scaled (network centrality +
association strength) and averaged to produce a module score.

Higher module scores indicate greater module activity in the direction
of disease progression.

**Input scale.** The function does no normalization or scaling of
`expr_matrix`; supply values that are already normalized and scaled.
Each module score is a weighted average of sign-aligned protein values,
so the scores inherit the scale of the input, whether that is a
rank-based inverse normal transformed (INT) scale, z-scaled log2 ratios,
or another choice appropriate to the platform. The bundled reference set
was built from SomaScan data on an INT scale. Scores computed on
differently normalized or scaled input are not directly comparable with
each other, and
[`predict_WSS()`](https://Longo-Lab.github.io/WSSmod/reference/predict_WSS.md)
predicts scores on the INT-based scale of the bundled reference.

**Missing values.** Modules are scored from the proteins that are
present in `expr_matrix` (see the return value for modules with no
proteins present), but missing values (`NA`) in a protein that a module
uses are not supported: the function stops with an error that names the
affected proteins. Impute the values, or drop the affected proteins or
samples, before scoring. Missing values in proteins that no module uses
are ignored.

## Examples

``` r
expr_matrix <- matrix(
  c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8),
  nrow = 2,
  dimnames = list(c("sample1", "sample2"), c("geneA", "geneB", "geneC", "geneD"))
)
cluster_result <- data.table::data.table(
  module = c("mod1", "mod1", "mod1", "mod2"),
  symbol = c("geneA", "geneB", "geneC", "geneD"),
  mean_beta = c(1, -1, 1, 1),
  mean_alpha_scaled = c(1, 1, 2, 1)
)

# Calculate Weighted Sum Scores (min_module_size = 1 to keep this toy example)
module_results <- calculate_WSS(expr_matrix, cluster_result, min_module_size = 1)

# Access score matrix
scores <- module_results$scores

# View summary statistics
print(module_results$summary_stats)
#>    module   Min    Q1 Median  Mean    Q3   Max
#>    <char> <num> <num>  <num> <num> <num> <num>
#> 1:   mod1     2 2.125   2.25  2.25 2.375   2.5
#> 2:   mod2     7 7.250   7.50  7.50 7.750   8.0

# Check standard deviations
print(module_results$module_sd)
#>      mod1      mod2 
#> 0.3535534 0.7071068 

# With no `result`, the default bundled reference set is used. The
# simulated example matrix has columns for all of its modules.
default_results <- calculate_WSS(wss_example_expression)
dim(default_results$scores)
